        <h3>Embracing the Era of Semantic-USDL <span>Published 8 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>
        Semantic USDL (SU) is created to semantically describe composite services. It initially is a part of HyperMash project produced by Feifei Hang in University of Manchester. Since it is based on Unified Service Description Language (USDL), which capture high-level concepts to describe Web services, it is also capable for describing composite services, which contain RESTful or/and SOAP-based services, created via any platforms/approaches other than HyperMash.

        <h3>Services Congress 2013, Santa Clara, USA <span>Published July, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>
        Just came back from Services Congress 2013, where I present my research work in early July. We met a great bunch of fantastic people in this community and started looking forward to collaborating with some of them in our future research.
        <br/><br/>
        Despite of the success of our presentation, I especially did enjoy the sunshine in Silicon Valley. For me it is extremely hard to imagine how those people from California could survive from the weather if they move to England (Manchester, more precisely). :-)
        <br/><br/>
        To be there in SC2013 is truly a good and unique opportunity for learning new stuffs, exchanging promising ideas, and even developing a solid network of relationship with others. Just cannot wait for the coming congress in 2014. :-)

        <h3>HyperMash: A Heterogeneous Service Composition Approach for Better Support of the End Users <span>Published July, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>The emergence of Web 2.0 and its related technologies such as HTML5 has empowered the end users and made it possible for them to compose their own Web applications. Yet, most of the current development has mainly concentrated on the support of the composition of enterprise- oriented services and scientific workflows, with not enough effort made to support the composition of end user-oriented services. This paper presents HyperMash, a service composition approach for the end users. The salient feature of this approach is its support of on demand heterogeneous service composition, which allows the end users to create their own composite services by combining RESTful services with SOAP-based services at runtime. In addition, to make it easier for the end users to compose RESTful services, HyperMash provides a full set of RESTful interface features. The paper describes the conceptual framework and working principles of HyperMash and illustrates the HyperMash approach through two examples.
