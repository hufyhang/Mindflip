        <h3>Where the heck do I host my … Node.js app? <span>Published 15 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>
        It’s a great time to be a developer. Also a confusing time. We are at a point where there are dozens of legit places that forward-thinking developers can run their apps in the cloud. I’ll be taking a look at a few different types of applications in a brief series of “where the heck do I host my …” blog posts. My goal with this series is to help developers wade through the sea of providers and choose the right one for their situation. In this first one, I’m looking at Node.js. It’s the darling of the startup set and is gaining awareness among a broad of developers. It also may be the single most supported platform in the cloud. Amazing for a technology that didn’t exist just a few years ago.

        <h3>The Dirty Secret about Cloud Service Level Agreements <span>Published 15 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>
        Has your cloud service provider had an outage that affected your users or business? If so, you are not alone. Ask Netflix, Instagram, and Vine—just a few of the high-profile companies that have had major service disruptions due to cloud infrastructure failures in recent months.
        <br/><br/>
        If the cloud is supposed to be so reliable, can companies offset some of their losses through the cloud service provider’s service level agreement (SLA)? Based on a recent review of the fine print, I would not count on it, because cloud service providers’ SLAs are notorious for being unreadable and unenforceable.

        <h3>A Journey Through Modern Design Trends <span>Published 15 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <div class="img-cont img-6"></div>
        <p>
        Over recent years, graphic design has seen quite a rapid change in popular trends.For the most part, current debates are focused on two styles and buzz words: ‘Skeuomorphic‘ and ‘Flat.’
        <br/><br/>
        Skeuomorphic describes design details that reference real life objects.
        <br/><br/>
        Flat describes that which is stripped of all gradients, textures, dimension, and realism.

        <h3>Node.js and the new web front-end <span>Published 8 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <p>
        Front-end engineers have a rather long and complicated history in software engineering. For the longest time, that stuff you sent to the browser was “easy enough” that anyone could do it and there was no real need for specialization. Many claimed that so-called web developers were nothing more than graphic designers using a different medium. The thought that one day you would be able to specialize in web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was laughable at best – the UI was, after all, something anyone could just hack together and have work.
        <br/><br/>
        JavaScript was the technology that really started to change the perception of web developers, changing them into front-end engineers. This quirky little toy language that many software engineers turned their noses up at became the driving force of the Internet. CSS and HTML then came along for the ride as more browsers were introduced, creating cross-browser incompatibilities that very clearly defined the need for front-end engineers. Today, front-end specialists are one of the most sought after candidates in the world.

        <h3>Backbone, Node, Express, and More : An Introduction to Full-Stack JavaScript, with Init.js<span>Published 8 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
        <div class="img-cont img-5"></div>
        <p>
        The Story
        <br/><br/>
        So, you and your co-founder have this great idea for a business, right?
        <br/><br/>
        You’ve been adding features in your mind.
        <br/><br/>
        Frequently, you ask potential customers for their opinions, and they all love it.
        <br/><br/>
        Ok, so people want it. There’s even some money to be made. And the only reason they can’t have it is because you haven’t implemented it—yet.
        <br/><br/>
        So finally, you sit down one day and say, “Let’s do it!” Soon, you’re trying to figure out how to implement your app’s business logic, the killer feature that will drive the product forward: you have an idea of how to do it, and you know you can do it.
        <br/><br/>
        “Done! It works!” you say. Your proof of concept is a success! All that’s left is to package it up into a web app.
        <br/><br/>
        “Ok, let’s create the site”, you say.
        <br/><br/>
        And then, you realize the truth: you need to choose a programing language; you need to choose a (modern) platform; you need to choose some (modern) frameworks; you need to configure (and purchase) storage, databases, and hosting providers; you need an admin interface; you need a permissions system; you need a content manager.
        <br/><br/>
        You want to be lean, you want to be agile. You want to use technologies that will help you succeed in the short- and long-term. And they’re not always easy to pick out.
        <br/><br/>
        You have tens upon tens of architectural decisions to make. And you want to make the right ones: you want to use technologies that allow for rapid development, constant iteration, maximal efficiency, speed, robustness, and more. You want to be lean, you want to be agile. You want to use technologies that will help you succeed in the short- and long-term. And they’re not always easy to pick out.

        “I’m overwhelmed,” you say, as you feel overwhelmed. Your energy is not the same as it once was. You try to piece things together, but it’s too much work.
        <br/><br/>
        Your proof of concept slowly withers and dies.

            <h3>Responsive Web Design: What It Is and How To Use It <span>Published 7 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
            <p>
            Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their website. It’s practically essential after all: one design for the BlackBerry, another for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must be compatible, too. In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop? It won’t, of course.
            <br/><br/>
            In the field of Web design and development, we’re quickly getting to the point of being unable to keep up with the endless new resolutions and devices. For many websites, creating a website version for each resolution and new device would be impossible, or at least impractical. Should we just suffer the consequences of losing visitors from one device, for the benefit of gaining visitors from another? Or is there another option?
            <br/><br/>
            Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.

            <h3>HCI 2.0? Usability meets Web 2.0 <span>Published 7 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
            <p>
            The web has already dramatically changed society, but the web itself is changing. Web2.0 sites mean that users have become the producers of content and the designers of each others' viewing experience.
            <br/><br/>
            Technologies such as AJAX combined with public Javascript libraries have allowed applications to be deployed that once would have required extensive programming. Open APIs and mashups make it difficult to tell the difference between a service, and application or a web page.
            <br/><br/>
            So what are the challenges for HCI when every user is designer, and every menu a different behaviour, when experience outranks efficiency, and connectivity replaces consistency?

            <h3>Why Flipboard makes sense as an app<span>Published 6 Oct, 2013</span></h3>
            <p>From <a href="http://boagworld.com/mobile-web/why-flipboard-makes-sense-as-an-app/" target="_blank">boagworld.com</a>
            <br/><br/>
            I have been speaking and writing quite a lot recently about the importance of developing a mobile strategy and when it is appropriate to develop mobile web techniques (such as responsive design) and when it is appropriate to develop an app. I’ve used what others have referred to as my pillars of app development. The three reasons; the only reasons, to consider developing an app. These are:<br/><br/>
            1.  The user is to complete a clearly defined task, or a small set of tasks.<br/>
            2. The user is to undertake this task on a regular basis.<br/>
            3. The user needs to make use of native device features such as the camera or GPS.<br/>
            <br/>
            If you can put a tick in one or more of these boxes then you have a case to build an app. Otherwise, if you are simply delivering content, it belongs on the web. Do not build and app for that!
            <br/><br/>
            A number of times now, either via comments on a post or in person when I’ve delivered a session at a conference, I have been asked; “..but what about Flipboard?”. Flipboard is just delivering content and has no need for native hardware features. They have also built their own immersive UI using HTML5 so there is not even a case to be made based on the use of device native user experience because the developers decided not use it. And yet, Flipboard is hugely successful and, indeed, I for one am a huge fan. It’s on my home screen, which speaks volumes.
            <br/><br/>
            There are a couple of very simple reasons why Flipboard (and all RSS readers for that matter) make perfect sense as an app. Hopefully this is useful to you when making decisions about your own mobile strategy.<br/><br/>
